The professional in Networks and Telecommunications, responsible for a technical project, is tasked with overseeing all stages of the project. This includes the design, implementation, and presentation of a technical solution that seamlessly integrates various technologies in networks, telecommunications, and information technology.

They also play a crucial role in coordinating the technicians involved in the project.

SAÃ‰ 51 constitutes an extensive project aimed at simulating a business project with the objective of assisting in the monitoring of disabled or elderly individuals. It also aims to help them with certain tasks that can be automated, thus making their lives easier. This project involves all RT (1, 2, and 3).

Due to its scope, this project requires a significant amount of time: we have 61 hours for its completion, with 7 hours and 30 minutes of separate classes to acquire additional concepts.

Three main objectives have been defined:

    Develop a monitoring system, from data capture to the graphical interface, addressing use cases related to person monitoring.
    Implement an indoor location system using various technologies (sensors) collaborating with the monitoring system.
    Conduct a spectral analysis of the environment equipped with sensors to verify compliance with regulations (ARCEP).

To meet these objectives, we need to deploy two use cases. The first use case must be chosen from three options:

    Detection of getting out of bed in the morning and opening the blinds in the bedroom and the next room.
    Detection of prolonged (abnormal) immobility in certain rooms (room identification) and triggering an alert.
    Detection of a call for help, location of the person in the house, and triggering an alert.

The second use case must be devised while still respecting the objectives and the stated issues.
